#About the project
The Spyrover (patent pending) is built for infiltration and identification. Sporting an ESP 32 Cam AI Thinker, the rover can capture and send live video while also being remotely controlled. Through either a webpage or twitch chat, commands can be sent remotely to the rover, allowing it to move around without a nearby operater presence.

#Disclaimer
Things are still WIP. Due to the rover owner's wifi going down (Garrett's) we were forced to use the ESP as a wireliess access point, which made it impossible to send messages and stream to twitch at the same time. However, aside from that the system is fully functional. Twitch commands can still be translated into commands, and all that's lest is to figure out a way to send them to the rover. As the rover is another network to connect to, it becomes impossible to stream on the internet and connect to the rover at the same time.

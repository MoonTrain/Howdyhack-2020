#About the project
The Spyrover (patent pending) is built for infiltration and identification. Sporting an ESP 32 Cam AI Thinker, the rover can capture and send live video while also being remotely controlled. Through either a webpage or twitch chat, commands can be sent remotely to the rover, allowing it to move around without a nearby operater presence.
